## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

### Technique Description：
My inspiration comes from the low-pixel art style of the game "Hot Spring Story." This pixel art technique has been popular in games since the last century, with examples like "Super Mario" and "Stardew Valley." Through simple color blocks and richly detailed scenes, it showcases complex game worlds and character designs. I believe pixel art is ideal for my project because it conveys rich visual information in a simplified form and is well-suited for coding. The arrangement and construction of each pixel lay the foundation for design, helping me build a visually compelling artistic project.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration

###  Coding technique：
This coding technique creates fire-like squares using a particle system, helping achieve the desired effect. The FireSquare class defines each square's properties, such as speed, color, and lifespan. The squares move upward at varying speeds and gradually disappear, simulating the natural rise and decay of flames. The use of the sine function (sin()) adds a realistic flickering effect to the fire. Additionally, by mapping the lifespan to the transparency value, the squares' opacity is controlled, allowing them to fade out smoothly and enhancing the visual realism of the fire simulation.
